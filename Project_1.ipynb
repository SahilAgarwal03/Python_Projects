        "The analysis of the rating distribution reveals that the majority of content on **Netflix** is focused on  mature audiences, with TV-MA and TV-14 being the most frequent ratings. This suggests a strong focus on adult viewers, particularly in TV shows.On the other hand, movies tend to be more evenly spread across ratings like PG, PG-13, and R, showing a slightly broader target audience. Additionally, ratings such as NC-17, TV-Y7-FV, and UR appear very infrequently, indicating limited content for very young children or highly explicit categories. Overall, the platform's content strategy seems to prioritize mature and teen-friendly material, especially through television series."
